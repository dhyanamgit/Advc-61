<h1>Once upon a time lived an alien with his friends in a spaceship.One day chanced upon him getting lost. He spent the whole day crying but no luck.He came upon a black hole.The hole sucked him but the alien did not die! He then came out of the blackhole through a Whitehole. To his luck he chanced upon his spaceship and went in. He told eveyone what happened.Then he said that"today was a really bad day for me".Then he slept and when he woke up, he realized he was in a dream! This happened evey night and one day he decided to go to a neurologist.When the doctor met the alien, the doctor said he is suffering from SSD which is "same scary dream" and said that take ebupruphen 3 times a day for 2 years.If it does no stop then come again for a surgery.The SSD did not stop and after 2 years the alien again went for a surgery but the surgery went wrong which resulted in death of the alien.The doctor said to the alien's friends that the only way the alien would come to life is by using the revive stone. The friend's went past all obstacles for the revive stone and bringing it back.After they brought it back , they gave it to the alien.The alien came to life and they lived happily ever after!</h1>
